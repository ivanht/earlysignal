# Welcome to EarlySignal

EarlySignal is an innovative project focused on early detection of incorrect system and service behaviors using Machine Learning. Our mission is to help organizations identify and address potential issues before they impact their services and users.

## What We Do

- Real-time system behavior monitoring
- Anomaly detection using ML
- Service health analysis
- Proactive alerting system
